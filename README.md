## 1.Packaging Evolution: From Basic 3D Integration
Semiconductor packaging is the process of enclosing and protecting a semiconductor chip (also called a die) so it can safely connect to the outside world, like a printed circuit board (PCB). It involves placing the chip in a supportive case, adding electrical connections, and shielding it from physical damage, heat, and moisture.  

It plays a critical role in:  
* **Protection**: Guards the chip from damage, dust, and moisture. 
* **Electrical Connection**: Links the chip to external circuits like PCBs.  
* **Heat Dissipation**: Releases heat to keep the chip cool. 
* **Mechanical Support**: Physically holds and secures the chip.
* **Signal Integrity**: Maintains clean and fast signal flow.
* **Miniaturization**: Enables compact design with multiple functions.
